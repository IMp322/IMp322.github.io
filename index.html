        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add pork; cook and stir until crumbly and no pink is showing, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove pork from the pan and set aside. Drain grease from the pan, leaving just a thin coating.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Add onion and garlic to the pan; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in the cooked pork, carrots, green onions, cabbage, and cilantro. Season with pepper, salt, garlic powder, and soy sauce. Remove from the heat, and set aside until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Assemble lumpia: Place 3 heaping tablespoons of filling diagonally near one corner of a lumpia wrapper, leaving a 1 1/2 inch space at both ends. Fold the side along the length of the filling over the filling, tuck in both ends, and roll neatly and tightly to close. Moisten the other side of the wrapper with water to seal the edge. Transfer to a plate and cover with plastic wrap to retain moisture. Repeat to assemble remaining lumpia.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Slide 3 to 4 lumpia into the hot oil, making sure the seams are facing down. Fry, turning occasionally, until all sides are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat to fry remaining lumpia. Serve immediately.

     <p><strong>Step 1:</strong>Marinate the chicken thighs in the adobo sauce for at least an hour, or as long as three hours. We put a cap on the marinade time because the white vinegar is super acidic, so it’ll start to mess with the texture of the chicken thighs after three hours.
     </p>
     <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Brown the chicken thighs! They don’t need to be cooked through—focus on getting a nice golden-brown color and slightly crisp texture.
     </p>
     <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Pour in the marinade and bring the chicken and sauce to a boil. Simmer until the sauce has reduced by half and the chicken is completely cooked through.
